<!-- 1. Different Data Types available in Javascript? -->
1. Premitive data type :-number, string, boolean, NULL, Infinity and symbol
2. Non Premitive data type :- object, array.

<!-- 2. In how many ways we can declare a variable -->
We can declares variable in three ways:
1.var
2.Let
3.const

<!-- 3. What is Hoisting -->
It is a default behaviour of JavaScript movining all the declearation at the top of scope before
code execution.

<!-- 4. What is temperal Dead Zone? -->
The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with 
the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable 
before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. 
The time span when that happens, between
the creation of a variable’s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.
ex - function somemethod() {
    console.log(counter1); 
    console.log(counter2); 
    var counter1 = 1;
    let counter2 = 2;
}

<!-- 5. What is the Difference between == & === Operator ? -->
Both are comparison operators. The difference between both the
operators is that,“==” is used to compare values whereas,“ === “ is
used to compare both value and datatypes.
var x="2";
var y=2;
console.log(x==y);   
console.log(x===y);  

<!-- 6. What are the Different types of Operators in Javascript -->
There are six type of Operators:-
1)Arithmetic Operators
2)Comparision Operators
3)Logical Operators
4)Relational Operators
5)Conditional Operator
